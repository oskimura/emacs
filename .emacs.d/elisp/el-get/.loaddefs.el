(autoload 'anything "anything" "\
Main function to execute anything sources.

Keywords supported:
:sources :input :prompt :resume :preselect :buffer :keymap :default :history
Extra keywords are supported and can be added, see below.

When call interactively with no arguments deprecated `anything-sources'
will be used if non--nil.

PLIST is a list like (:key1 val1 :key2 val2 ...) or
\(&optional sources input prompt resume preselect buffer keymap default history).

Basic keywords are the following:

:sources

Temporary value of `anything-sources'.  It also accepts a
symbol, interpreted as a variable of an anything source.  It
also accepts an alist representing an anything source, which is
detected by (assq 'name ANY-SOURCES)

:input

Temporary value of `anything-pattern', ie. initial input of minibuffer.

:prompt

Prompt other than \"pattern: \".

:resume

If t, Resurrect previously instance of `anything'.  Skip the initialization.
If 'noresume, this instance of `anything' cannot be resumed.

:preselect

Initially selected candidate.  Specified by exact candidate or a regexp.

:buffer

`anything-buffer' instead of *anything*.

:keymap

`anything-map' for current `anything' session.

:default

A default argument that will be inserted in minibuffer with \\<minibuffer-local-map>\\[next-history-element].
When nil of not present `thing-at-point' will be used instead.

:history

By default all minibuffer input is pushed to `minibuffer-history',
if an argument HISTORY is provided, input will be pushed to HISTORY.
History element should be a symbol.

Of course, conventional arguments are supported, the two are same.

\(anything :sources sources :input input :prompt prompt :resume resume
           :preselect preselect :buffer buffer :keymap keymap :default default
           :history history)
\(anything sources input prompt resume preselect buffer keymap default history)

Other keywords are interpreted as local variables of this anything session.
The `anything-' prefix can be omitted.  For example,

\(anything :sources 'anything-c-source-buffers
           :buffer \"*buffers*\" :candidate-number-limit 10)

means starting anything session with `anything-c-source-buffers'
source in *buffers* buffer and set variable `anything-candidate-number-limit'
to 10 as session local variable.

\(fn &rest PLIST)" t nil)

(autoload 'anything-at-point "anything" "\

ANY-SOURCES ANY-INPUT ANY-PROMPT ANY-RESUME ANY-PRESELECT and ANY-BUFFER

(autoload 'erlang-mode "erlang" "\
Major mode for editing Erlang source files in Emacs.
It knows about syntax and comment, it can indent code, it is capable
of fontifying the source file, the TAGS commands are aware of Erlang
modules, and the Erlang man pages can be accessed.

Should this module, \"erlang.el\", be installed properly, Erlang mode
is activated whenever an Erlang source or header file is loaded into
Emacs.  To indicate this, the mode line should contain the word
\"Erlang\".

The main feature of Erlang mode is indentation, press TAB and the
current line will be indented correctly.

Comments starting with one `%' are indented with the same indentation
as code.  Comments starting with at least two `%':s are indented to
the first column.

However, Erlang mode contains much more, this is a list of the most
useful commands:
     TAB     - Indent the line.
     C-c C-q - Indent current function.
     M-;     - Create a comment at the end of the line.
     M-q     - Fill a comment, i.e. wrap lines so that they (hopefully)
                 will look better.
     M-a     - Goto the beginning of an Erlang clause.
     M-C-a   - Ditto for function.
     M-e     - Goto the end of an Erlang clause.
     M-C-e   - Ditto for function.
     M-h     - Mark current Erlang clause.
     M-C-h   - Ditto for function.
     C-c C-z - Start, or switch to, an inferior Erlang shell.
     C-c C-k - Compile current file.
     C-x `   - Next error.
     ,       - Electric comma.
     ;       - Electric semicolon.

Erlang mode check the name of the file against the module name when
saving, whenever a mismatch occurs Erlang mode offers to modify the
source.

The variable `erlang-electric-commands' controls the electric
commands.  To deactivate all of them, set it to nil.

There exists a large number of commands and variables in the Erlang
module.  Please press `M-x apropos RET erlang RET' to see a complete
list.  Press `C-h f name-of-function RET' and `C-h v name-of-variable
RET'to see the full description of functions and variables,
respectively.

On entry to this mode the contents of the hook `erlang-mode-hook' is
executed.

Please see the beginning of the file `erlang.el' for more information
and examples of hooks.

\\{erlang-mode-map}

(autoload 'go-mode "go-mode" "\
Major mode for editing Go source text.

This mode provides (not just) basic editing capabilities for
working with Go code. It offers almost complete syntax
highlighting, indentation that is almost identical to gofmt and
proper parsing of the buffer content to allow features such as
navigation by function, manipulation of comments or detection of
strings.

In addition to these core features, it offers various features to
help with writing Go code. You can directly run buffer content
through gofmt, read godoc documentation from within Emacs, modify
and clean up the list of package imports or interact with the
Playground (uploading and downloading pastes).

The following extra functions are defined:

- `gofmt'
- `godoc'
- `go-import-add'
- `go-remove-unused-imports'
- `go-goto-imports'
- `go-play-buffer' and `go-play-region'
- `go-download-play'
- `godef-describe' and `godef-jump'
- `go-coverage'

If you want to automatically run `gofmt' before saving a file,
add the following hook to your emacs configuration:

\(add-hook 'before-save-hook 'gofmt-before-save)

If you want to use `godef-jump' instead of etags (or similar),
consider binding godef-jump to `M-.', which is the default key
for `find-tag':

\(add-hook 'go-mode-hook (lambda ()
                          (local-set-key (kbd \"M-.\") 'godef-jump)))

Please note that godef is an external dependency. You can install
it with

go get code.google.com/p/rog-go/exp/cmd/godef


If you're looking for even more integration with Go, namely
on-the-fly syntax checking, auto-completion and snippets, it is
recommended that you look at goflymake
\(https://github.com/dougm/goflymake), gocode
\(https://github.com/nsf/gocode) and yasnippet-go
